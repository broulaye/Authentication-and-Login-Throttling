# Project 6 - Globitek Authentication and Login Throttling

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

1\. "staff/users/new.php" and "staff/users/edit.php"
  * [x]  Form with inputs for "Password" and "Confirm Password"
  * [x]  Strong password requirements text

2\. Data validations
  * [x]  Returns an error if password or confirm_password are blank.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password and confirm_password do not match.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password is not at least 12 characters long.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password does not meet character requirements.
  * [x]  Returns any errors related to other validations already on the user.

3\. Saving a user
  * [x]  Encrypts the password
  * [x]  Stores the password in the database

4\. Login page
  * [x]  Verify the correct password.
  * [x]  Do not create a User Enumeration vulnerability.

5\. If a user fails to log in:
  * [x]  Record the failed login for the first 5 attempts.
  * [x]  Return a "too many failed logins" message after 5 attempts.
  * [x]  Future attempts will show the number of minutes remaining in the lockout.
  * [x]  After the lockout period, the failed logins count resets to 0.

6\. After any successful login:
  * [x]  Set the failed_logins.count for the username to 0.

7\. SQLi and XSS
  * [x]  Do not introduce any SQLI Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

The following advanced user stories are optional:

* Bonus Objective 1\.
  * [x]  Identify the subtle Username Enumeration weakness. Include a short description of how the code could be modified to be more secure below:
  * The weakness is that the user can figure out that an username is valid if the login locks after 5 tries. to fix it, you have to lock it after 5 tries even if the username is not valid and as long as the same username is being used 5 times.

* Bonus Objective 2\.
  * [x]  User password validations only run when the password is not blank.
  * [x]  `update_user` only encrypts and updates the password when the password is not blank.

* Bonus Objective 3\.
  * [x]  Create a new user using cost 10.
  * [x]  Set bcrypt "cost" parameter to 11 (for both insert and update).
  * [x]  Try to login with the "cost 10" user.
  * [x]  Briefly describe why login still works even after the cost is changed:
  * because the used algorithm, cost and salt are returned as part of the hash, all information that's needed to verify the hash is included in it. so when password very is used it will use a cost 10 to verify the password instead of cost 11.

* Bonus Objective 4\.
  * [x]  Add "Previous password" to "public/staff/users/edit.php"
  * [x]  Validate the previous password before allowing the password to be updated.
  * [x]  Require previous password only if new password is being updated (if also completing Bonus Objective 2).

* Advanced Objective 1\.
  * [x]  Implement `password_hash()` on your own as `my_password_hash()`.
  * [x]  Implement `password_verify()` on your own as `my_password_verify()`.

* Advanced Objective 2\.
  * [x]  Write `generate_strong_password()`
  * [x]  Add a suggestion for a 12-character strong password to the new and edit user pages.
